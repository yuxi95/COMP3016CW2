# COMP3016CW2
# Project Name
To see a world in a drop water
# Project Summary
This project is inspired by the classic Buddhist saying "See a world in a flower,and a bodhi in a leaf". OpenGL and C++ are used to develop a Zen journey project presented from a first-person
perspective to highlight the theme. PCG will be used to interact with users. By clicking on water
droplets, users will enter a virtual Zen-like virtual environment and experience the tranquil beauty of "See a world in a flower,and a bodhi in a leaf"
# Project Aim
Achieve an engaging first-point virtual journey that allows users to interact with Zen
and nature in harmony.
# Main Features
- Immerse users in the virtual environment through the first perspective display
- By clicking on the water drop to achieve interactive triggering, guide users into the Zen scene
- Zen scenes incorporate natural elements, dynamic light and shadow, and ambient sound
- The user controls the viewing Angle through the mouse or keyboard, allowing the user to roam
freely in the scene and interact with the scene
# Technology implementation
## Coding Environment
- Uses Visual Studio 2022 as the primary integrated development environment
- Configure the project to support the OpenGL development environment
-  Develop in c++
## Dynamic scene generation
- Use OpenGL to achieve high-quality graphics rendering such as lighting, etc.
Libraries and frameworks
- Use the OpenGL library to achieve first-person perspective rendering effects
- Integrated GLEW to manage OpenGL extensions
- GLFW creates windows and handles user input
# Instruction manual
The scene can be moved by moving it with the mouse
